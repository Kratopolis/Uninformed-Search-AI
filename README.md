# uninformed_search_AI
An example of a few uninformed search algorithms including Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search, with Linked Node, Queue, and Stack data structures implemented

In this project are three different algorithms for uninformed searching:
1. Breadth-First Search
2. Depth-First Search non-recursive
3. Depth-First Search recursive

All of these algorithms are implemented using Queues(BFS), Stacks(DFS non-recursive), and recursion(DFS recursive)
